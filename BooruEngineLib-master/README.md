# BooruEngineLib

Java library for fast and easy access to *boor APIs. 
It has simple functionality - you can create request to *boor and receive data.
At this moment BEL supports only GET requests - you can search posts by id, by tags, create custom requests and searching comments by post_id.
But with high integrity level for new boors.
